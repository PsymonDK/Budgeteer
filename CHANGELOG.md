## [0.24.0] - 2026-03-26 — Individual expenses

### Added
- **Individual expense ownership** — expenses can now be assigned to a specific household member via an optional "Assigned to" dropdown in the add/edit form; unassigned expenses remain shared (split by income %)
- **Owner badge on expense rows** — individual expenses display the owner's name as a blue chip in the expenses table
- **Per-member split breakdown on dashboard** — the member expense splits table now shows three columns: Shared owed (proportional split of shared pool), Individual (expenses assigned solely to that member), and Total owed

### Changed
- `Expense` schema: added `ownedByUserId String?` with a `SetNull` foreign key to `User`; all existing expenses default to `null` (shared)
- Dashboard API `memberSplits` response shape: replaced `monthlyExpensesOwed` with `monthlySharedOwed`, `monthlyIndividualOwed`, and `monthlyTotalOwed`
- Expense API (`POST`/`PUT`) validates that `ownedByUserId`, when provided, is an actual member of the household; returns 400 otherwise

---

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-26 — Currency selection for expenses, salary & bonuses

### Added
- **Currency selector for salary records** — salary form now has a currency dropdown; gross/net amounts are stored in the chosen currency alongside the exchange rate; `getJobMonthlyIncome` converts to base currency for all income calculations
- **Currency selector for bonuses** — bonus form has the same currency dropdown with a live base-currency preview
- **Auto-sync currencies on first boot** — API syncs 31 currencies from Danmarks Nationalbank on startup if the `CurrencyRate` table is empty, so the expense/savings/income currency dropdowns have options without requiring a manual admin trigger
- **Edit & delete salary records** — each salary record in the history modal now has Edit and Delete buttons; editing pre-fills the form inline with a Cancel action

### Changed
- `SalaryRecord` schema: added `currencyCode String?` and `rateUsed Decimal?(18,6)`
- `Bonus` schema: added `currencyCode String?` and `rateUsed Decimal?(18,6)`
- Salary history table shows a Currency column
- Both salary and bonus forms show a "≈ X {base} " live preview when a foreign currency is selected

---

## [0.22.0] - 2026-03-26 — Sprint 22: Visual Identity & Polish

### Added
- **Design tokens in `tailwind.config.js`** — registered semantic color tokens (`brand.primary`, `brand.primary-hover`, `surface.base`, `surface.raised`, `surface.overlay`) with inline comments; existing Tailwind class names remain valid, tokens can be adopted incrementally (UX-018)
- **Favicon** — SVG skull-and-crossbones favicon at `apps/web/public/favicon.svg` displayed in the browser tab (UX-019)
- **Open Graph meta tags** — `og:title` and `og:description` added to `index.html` for link previews (UX-019)

### Changed
- **Browser tab title** — changed from "Personal Budgeteer" to "Budgeteer" in `index.html` (UX-019)
- **On-brand empty state copy** — replaced generic placeholder text across 10+ locations with pirate-flavored alternatives (UX-020):
  - "No households yet" → "No crews assembled yet"
  - "No savings entries yet" → "No gold stashed yet"
  - "No budget years yet" → "Your treasure chest is empty — no budget years yet"
  - "No simulations." → "No simulations charted."
  - "No custom categories yet" → "Uncharted territory — no custom categories yet" (CategoriesPage & CategoriesAdminPage)
  - "No expenses yet." → "No plunder recorded yet." (ExpensesPage & DashboardPage)
  - "No expenses match the filter" → "No plunder matches the filter" (ExpensesPage & ComparePage)
  - "No budget years recorded yet" → "No voyages logged yet" (HistoryPage)
  - "No jobs yet" → "No work on the horizon yet" (IncomePage)
  - "No households yet." → "No crews on the seas yet." (HouseholdsAdminPage)

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-26 — Sprint 21: Consistency Pass

### Added
- **`CategoryFilter` component** — reusable pill-based multi-select for category filtering (`apps/web/src/components/CategoryFilter.tsx`); replaces the single `<select>` dropdown on ExpensesPage and extracts the inline pill filter from ComparePage (UX-017)
- **`PageHeader` in-page title component** — repurposed from nav bar to a title section with `title`, `subtitle`, and `action` slot; applied to all feature pages: Expenses, Categories, Budget Years, Savings, Household Income, Compare, History, Personal Income, Profile, and Households (UX-014)

### Changed
- **`Modal` size prop** — replaced freeform `maxWidth` string with typed `size` enum (`sm | md | lg`); confirmation dialogs use `sm`, standard forms use `md`, complex forms use `lg`; all modal usages across 7 pages updated (UX-016)
- **`inputClass` consolidated** — added `text-sm` to shared definition in `lib/styles.ts`; removed local redeclarations from LoginPage, ProfilePage, ChangePasswordPage, IncomePage, UsersPage (UX-015)
- `HouseholdsPage` (root `/`) now wrapped in `GlobalLayout` for a consistent header with logo and user menu
- ExpensesPage category filter upgraded from single-select dropdown to multi-select `CategoryFilter` pills

---

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-26 — Sprint 20: Navigation Clarity & Routing

### Added
- **`GlobalLayout`** — shared header (logo + "← Back to household" link using `HouseholdContext` + user menu) wrapping `/`, `/income`, `/profile`, `/change-password`; replaces per-page `<PageHeader />` nav bars (UX-011)
- **`AdminLayout`** — shared admin header (logo + nav: Users / Households / Categories with active states) wrapping all 3 admin pages; consolidates the 3 different inline headers that existed before (UX-012)
- **`NotFoundPage`** — pirate-themed 404 page replacing the silent `<Navigate to="/" replace />` catch-all; includes a link back to home (UX-013)

### Changed
- Sidebar nav label: `Income` → `Household Income`; header link: `My income` → `Personal Income` to distinguish the two income pages (UX-010)
- Admin pages (`UsersPage`, `HouseholdsAdminPage`, `CategoriesAdminPage`) — inline headers removed; now rendered by `AdminLayout`
- Standalone personal pages — `<PageHeader />` nav bar removed from `IncomePage`, `ProfilePage`, `ChangePasswordPage`; header provided by `GlobalLayout`

---

## [0.19.0] - 2026-03-26 — Sprint 19: UX/UI Polish & Consistency

### Added
- **Shared style primitives** — `lib/styles.ts` exports `inputClass`, `selectClass`, `primaryBtn`, `secondaryBtn`, `dangerBtn` for consistent form and button styling across pages (UX-002)
- **`LoadingSpinner` / `PageLoader`** — shared spinner component; replaces all inline "Loading…" text across the app (UX-004)
- **`Modal` portal component** — shared `<Modal>` with Escape-to-close and click-outside-to-close; all inline modals replaced (UX-003)
- **`PageHeader` component** (later evolved in Sprint 21) — initial extraction for standalone pages (UX-006)
- **Sonner toast notifications** — `<Toaster>` wired in `App.tsx`; `toast.success` added to all create/update/delete mutations (UX-002)
- **Mobile sidebar hamburger** — `HouseholdLayout` gains a `<Menu>` button and overlay drawer on small screens (UX-008)

### Changed
- All destructive actions in HouseholdPage and IncomePage (close job, delete bonus/override, remove member) now show a confirmation dialog before proceeding (UX-001)
- Hover-only action buttons (ExpensesPage, SavingsPage) fixed to use `opacity-0 md:group-hover:opacity-100` (UX-005)
- Sort icons in HistoryPage and ExpensesPage replaced from `▲▼` characters to Lucide `ChevronUp`/`ChevronDown` (UX-007)
- Allocation dirty-state tracking, Save button, and 100% cap validation added to IncomePage allocation grid (UX-009)

## [0.17.0] - 2026-03-25 — Avatar, Bookkeeper Role & Household Switcher

### Added
- **User avatar** — circular avatar in all headers; initials fallback with deterministic colour (8-colour palette, name-hashed); BOOKKEEPER and SYSTEM_ADMIN users show an amber ring (AVT-001)
- **Avatar upload** — profile page lets users upload a JPG/PNG/WebP (max 2 MB); stored server-side via `POST /users/me/avatar`; served as static files from `UPLOAD_DIR/avatars/`; `DELETE /users/me/avatar` reverts to initials (AVT-002)
- **Header user dropdown** — clicking the avatar opens a menu with name, email, Profile link, and Sign out; replaces the plain user-name link and separate sign-out button (AVT-003)
- **`@fastify/multipart`** and **`@fastify/static`** registered in the API for file upload handling and avatar serving; `UPLOAD_DIR` env var (default `./uploads`) controls storage location
- **`BOOKKEEPER` role** — added to `Role` enum between `SYSTEM_ADMIN` and `USER`; `requireBookkeeperOrAdmin` middleware exported from authenticate plugin; admin user management page shows role selector and Bookkeeper option (BK-001)
- **Proxy users** — `isProxy Boolean` field on `User`; proxy users cannot log in (403 on `/auth/login`); admin can create proxy users without a password; proxy users cannot be given elevated roles (BK-003)
- **Bookkeeper proxy income entry** — BOOKKEEPER and SYSTEM_ADMIN can manage income for proxy users via `GET /users/:id/jobs` (extended permission check); "Manage income →" link shown next to proxy members in household settings; `/income?proxyUserId=` opens IncomePage with a banner "Entering income on behalf of [name]" (BK-002)
- **Household switcher** — header dropdown listing all user households with fast switching; selecting a household navigates to the same sub-page in the new household; single-household users see a static label (HH-010)
- **`HouseholdContext`** — React context provider wrapping the app; `useHousehold()` hook; active household persisted to `localStorage` key `budgeteer_active_household`; validated against current membership on app load; falls back to `defaultHouseholdId` → first household (HH-010)
- **Default household pin** — pin icon in household switcher dropdown sets `defaultHouseholdId` in `UserPreferences`; current default shown with filled pin icon (HH-011)

### Changed
- `GET /users/me` now returns `avatarUrl` and `isProxy` fields
- `POST /users` accepts optional `isProxy` flag; proxy users skip password requirement
- `PUT /users/:id` accepts `role` and `isProxy` updates (admin only)
- Job ownership checks now allow BOOKKEEPER access to proxy users' jobs across all job/salary/bonus/override endpoints

---

## [0.16.0] - 2026-03-25 — Sprint 16: Category Icons

### Added
- **Icon field on expense categories** — optional `icon String?` added to `ExpenseCategory` schema; stores a Lucide icon name (e.g. `"Home"`, `"Zap"`); defaults to `"Tag"` at render time if unset (CAT-010)
- **Icon picker** — scrollable, searchable grid of all 1,400+ Lucide icons in the create-category modal; uses `lucide-react/dynamicIconImports` for the full index without upfront bundle cost; icons loaded lazily on demand (CAT-011)
- **`CategoryIcon` component** — shared `apps/web/src/components/CategoryIcon.tsx` renders a Lucide icon by name via dynamic import with `Tag` as static fallback; zero bundle cost for icons not assigned to any category (CAT-012)
- **Icon rendering throughout UI** — category icons appear in expense table rows, compare view category chips and table, dashboard by-category section, and category management tables (CAT-012)
- **Default system category icons in seed** — Housing→Home, Transport→Car, Utilities→Zap, Food & Groceries→ShoppingCart, Insurance→Shield, Subscriptions→RefreshCw, Healthcare→Heart, Savings→PiggyBank, Other→Tag; seed is idempotent (CAT-013)

---

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-25 — Sprint 15: User Profile

### Added
- **`UserPreferences` model** — `preferredCurrency`, `defaultHouseholdId`, four notification toggles (`notifyOverAllocation`, `notifyExpensesExceedIncome`, `notifyNoSavings`, `notifyUncategorised`); created automatically with defaults when a new user is created (USR-003)
- **Profile API** — `GET /users/me` (profile + preferences), `PUT /users/me` (name/email; email change requires current password), `PUT /users/me/preferences` (partial update with upsert) (USR-001, USR-003)
- **Income summary API** — `GET /users/me/income/summary` returns totalMonthly, totalAllocated, totalUnallocated, allocationPct, overAllocated across all active jobs and their household allocations (USR-004)
- **Income trend API** — `GET /users/me/income/trend` resolves salary history server-side for each of the past 12 months; returns per-job monthly arrays, combined total, and bonus markers (USR-005)
- **Income Sankey API** — `GET /users/me/income/sankey` returns d3-sankey-shaped `{ nodes, links }` showing job → income total → household → expenses/savings/surplus flow; unallocated node omitted when fully allocated (USR-006)
- **Profile page** (`/profile`) — three-tab layout: Profile | Income | Households (USR-002)
  - *Profile tab*: editable name/email (email change requires inline password confirmation), Change Password button, preferred currency select (from `/currencies`), default household select, four notification preference toggles with auto-save (USR-003)
  - *Income tab*: summary bar (4 stat cards with over-allocation badge), 12-month recharts line chart with per-job coloured lines + dashed total + bonus dot markers, d3-sankey SVG flow diagram, link to full job management at `/income` (USR-004, USR-005, USR-006, USR-007)
  - *Households tab*: list of user's households with role badge, budget year status, and quick links to open each household; over-allocation warning banner (USR-008)
- **Profile navigation** — user's name in the household top-bar header links to `/profile` (USR-001)

---

## [0.14.1] - 2026-03-25 — Auth improvements + sidebar navigation

### Added
- **Admin password reset** — system admins can reset any user's password via a modal on the Users page; sets `mustChangePassword=true` so the user must choose a new password on next login
- **User self-service password change** — `POST /users/me/change-password` verifies current password and clears the `mustChangePassword` flag; accessible from a "Change password" link in the header nav
- **Mandatory change-password flow** — `ProtectedRoute` redirects to `/change-password` when `mustChangePassword` is set, blocking access to all other pages until complete; the page switches to an optional flow (with cancel) for voluntary changes
- **Household left sidebar navigation** — all household sub-pages now share a `HouseholdLayout` wrapper rendered via React Router v6 nested routes; a fixed `w-56` sidebar (lucide-react icons, active highlight via `useLocation`) replaces the bottom "Manage" button grid on the dashboard; top header shows household name and right-side links (My income, Users for admins, Change password, Sign out)

### Changed
- `App.tsx` — 9 flat `/households/:id/*` routes replaced by a single nested route under `HouseholdLayout`; `DashboardPage` no longer renders the "Manage" section
- Admin `UsersPage` brand link changed from plain text to a `<Link>` so users can navigate back from the admin area

---

### Added
- **Job-centric income model** — replaces the flat `IncomeEntry` with `Job`, `SalaryRecord`, `MonthlyIncomeOverride`, and `Bonus` models; `HouseholdIncomeAllocation` now references `jobId`
- **Salary history resolution** — `lib/incomeCalc.ts` helpers (`getJobMonthlyIncome`, `calcIncomeForYear`) resolve the active salary for any month using the most recent `SalaryRecord` where `effectiveFrom <= month`; monthly overrides take precedence
- **Bonuses** — `includeInBudget` toggle + budget mode (`ONE_OFF` or `SPREAD_ANNUALLY`) controls whether a bonus is factored into the annual income calculation
- **Jobs API** (`routes/jobs.ts`) — full CRUD for jobs, salary records, monthly overrides, bonuses, allocations, and `GET /jobs/history` income history endpoint
- **Income page rewrite** — three-tab UI: Jobs & Salary / Monthly Overrides / Bonuses; allocation grid per household; recharts history chart of monthly income over time

### Changed
- Dashboard, compare, and savings-history endpoints updated to use `incomeCalc` helpers
- Demo seed data updated to use `Job` / `SalaryRecord` / `Bonus` records instead of `IncomeEntry`

---

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-25 — Sprint 13: Currency Support

### Added
- **Base currency configuration** — `BASE_CURRENCY` env var (default `DKK`); `GET /config` returns `baseCurrency` to the frontend (CUR-001)
- **Exchange rate sync** — fetches and parses Danmarks Nationalbank XML feed via `fast-xml-parser`; rates stored in new `CurrencyRate` table (CUR-002)

- **Manual rate refresh** — `POST /admin/currencies/refresh` (admin only) triggers an immediate rate sync (CUR-004)
- **Foreign-currency expenses and savings** — `currencyCode`, `originalAmount`, `rateUsed`, `rateDate` fields on `Expense` and `SavingsEntry`; UI shows currency selector, original amount, and applied rate in add/edit forms and table rows (CUR-005)
- **Rate snapshot on payment** — nightly job locks `rateUsed` / `rateDate` for expenses and savings entries once their `frequencyPeriod` date has passed (CUR-006)
- **Currency API** — `GET /currencies` (latest rates), `GET /currencies/:code/history` (CUR-007)
- `SavingsEntry` gains `frequencyPeriod` field to support payment-date rate locking

---

## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-24 — Infrastructure: Docker fixes + Prisma v7 upgrade

### Changed
- **Prisma v5 → v7** — added `prisma.config.ts` with `@prisma/adapter-pg` migrate adapter; `PrismaClient` now uses the PrismaPg driver adapter; `--schema` flags removed from npm scripts (handled by config file); `Dockerfile.api` copies `prisma.config.ts`

### Added
- **Auth** — JWT login (15 min access token + 7 day refresh token), token rotation on refresh, refresh token invalidation on logout (AUTH-001, AUTH-002, AUTH-003)
- **Account lockout** — 10 consecutive failed login attempts locks the account for 15 minutes (AUTH-001)
- **First-run seed** — admin user created from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `ADMIN_NAME` env vars on first boot; `mustChangePassword` flag set (ADMIN-001)
- **User management API** — `GET /users`, `POST /users`, `PUT /users/:id`; password never returned; email uniqueness enforced (ADMIN-002, ADMIN-003)
- **User management UI** — admin-only Users page with create and edit/deactivate modals (ADMIN-002, ADMIN-003)
- **Protected routes** — `ProtectedRoute` component redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`; `requireAdmin` guard returns 403 for non-admins
- **Silent token refresh** — Axios response interceptor transparently refreshes access token on 401 and queues concurrent requests (AUTH-002)
- **Login page** — email/password form with error display
- **Prisma schema extensions** — `failedLoginAttempts`, `lockedUntil` fields added to `User`

### Changed
- `docker-compose.yml` moved to repo root; postgres healthcheck added so API waits for DB before starting
- `docker/entrypoint.sh` — switched from `prisma migrate deploy` to `prisma db push` (no migration files required at this stage)
- `Dockerfile.api` — added `openssl` via `apk` to fix Prisma engine binary on Alpine
- `Dockerfile.web` — added `vite-env.d.ts` reference to fix `import.meta.env` TypeScript error
- CORS origin now reads from `CORS_ORIGIN` env var (was hardcoded to Vite dev URL)
- `docker-compose.yml` exposes postgres on port 5432 to allow local `prisma migrate dev`
