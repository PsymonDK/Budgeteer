## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-24 — Sprint 4: Expense Categories

### Added
- **Categories API** — `GET /categories?householdId=`, `POST /categories`, `POST /categories/:id/promote`, `DELETE /categories/:id` with optional `{ replacementId }` body (CAT-001 – CAT-004)
- **Default system categories** seeded on first boot: Housing, Transport, Utilities, Food & Groceries, Insurance, Subscriptions, Healthcare, Savings, Other (CAT-001)
- **Custom category creation** — scoped to household; enforces name uniqueness within household; returns a warning if name duplicates a system-wide category (CAT-002)
- **Promote to system-wide** — system admin only; sets `isSystemWide: true`, clears `householdId`; all existing expenses on the category are unaffected as the FK stays the same (CAT-003)
- **Delete with reassignment** — returns 409 with expense count if category is in use; accepts `replacementId` to atomically reassign all expenses then delete (CAT-004)
- **Categories page** (`/households/:id/categories`) — lists system-wide and custom categories; household admins can create/delete; system admins can promote and delete system-wide (CAT-001 – CAT-004)
- **Admin categories page** (`/admin/categories`) — shows all custom categories across all households with promote action (CAT-003)
- Categories link added to household detail page

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-24 — Sprint 3: Households

### Added
- **Household API** — `GET/POST /households`, `GET/PUT /households/:id`, member endpoints (`POST/PUT/DELETE /households/:id/members`) (HH-001 – HH-004)
- **Households page** (`/`) — lists all user households with member count and role badge; create household modal navigates directly into the new household (HH-001, HH-004)
- **Household detail page** (`/households/:id`) — inline name editing (admin), members table with role toggle and remove actions; last-admin guard enforced on both frontend and API (HH-002, HH-003)
- **Admin households page** (`/admin/households`) — system admin view of all households with member count and admin names (ADMIN-004)
- `GET /users` now accessible to all authenticated users so household admins can select members from the full user list (HH-002)
- Income allocations are preserved on member removal — they live on `IncomeEntry`, not `HouseholdMember` (HH-003)

### Changed
- `App.tsx` — placeholder Dashboard replaced by `HouseholdsPage`; added `/households/:id` and `/admin/households` routes

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-24 — Sprint 2: Auth & User Management

### Added
- **Auth** — JWT login (15 min access token + 7 day refresh token), token rotation on refresh, refresh token invalidation on logout (AUTH-001, AUTH-002, AUTH-003)
- **Account lockout** — 10 consecutive failed login attempts locks the account for 15 minutes (AUTH-001)
- **First-run seed** — admin user created from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `ADMIN_NAME` env vars on first boot; `mustChangePassword` flag set (ADMIN-001)
- **User management API** — `GET /users`, `POST /users`, `PUT /users/:id`; password never returned; email uniqueness enforced (ADMIN-002, ADMIN-003)
- **User management UI** — admin-only Users page with create and edit/deactivate modals (ADMIN-002, ADMIN-003)
- **Protected routes** — `ProtectedRoute` component redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`; `requireAdmin` guard returns 403 for non-admins
- **Silent token refresh** — Axios response interceptor transparently refreshes access token on 401 and queues concurrent requests (AUTH-002)
- **Login page** — email/password form with error display
- **Prisma schema extensions** — `failedLoginAttempts`, `lockedUntil` fields added to `User`

### Changed
- `docker-compose.yml` moved to repo root; postgres healthcheck added so API waits for DB before starting
- `docker/entrypoint.sh` — switched from `prisma migrate deploy` to `prisma db push` (no migration files required at this stage)
- `Dockerfile.api` — added `openssl` via `apk` to fix Prisma engine binary on Alpine
- `Dockerfile.web` — added `vite-env.d.ts` reference to fix `import.meta.env` TypeScript error
- CORS origin now reads from `CORS_ORIGIN` env var (was hardcoded to Vite dev URL)
- `docker-compose.yml` exposes postgres on port 5432 to allow local `prisma migrate dev`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-01 — Sprint 1: Project Scaffolding & Docker

### Added
- Monorepo structure: `apps/web` (React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind), `apps/api` (Fastify + TypeScript + Prisma), `packages/shared` (DEV-001)
- `docker-compose.yml` with web, api, and postgres services; named volume for data persistence (DEV-002)
- `.env.example` documenting all required environment variables (DEV-002)
- Prisma schema — full data model: `User`, `Household`, `HouseholdMember`, `BudgetYear`, `IncomeEntry`, `HouseholdIncomeAllocation`, `ExpenseCategory`, `Expense`, `SavingsEntry`, `RefreshToken`
- API health endpoint `GET /health`
- React frontend skeleton with Tailwind CSS
